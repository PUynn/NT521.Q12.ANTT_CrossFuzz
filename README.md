# CrossFuzz – Cross-Contract Fuzzing for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection

## Overview

The project focuses on **CrossFuzz – a cross-contract fuzzing approach for smart contract vulnerability detection**.  
This repository is mainly used to **store smart contracts** that are executed as fuzzing targets for different fuzzing tools.
